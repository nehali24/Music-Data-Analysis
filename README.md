# Music-Data-Analysis
This an analysis of harmonic data, provided by Datacamp. It explains how musicians follow trend to choose nodes and chords.
During analysis of this dataset i would see that chords that were being chosen most frequently were C:maj, G:maj, A:maj, D:maj, F:maj, E:maj, Bb:maj, B:maj, Ab:maj and Eb:maj. When i tried plotting the share of total chords wrt individual chord selected i found that max share was found for C:maj and min for A:min7. 
 Bigram Count: When the bigram count was analysed then top Bigrams in descreasing order were G:maj D:maj, C:maj F:maj, C:maj G:maj	, B:maj E:maj, F:maj C:maj being the top 5. 
 
 When a plot was obtained for the bigram count, i could see that in graph what i got in table above. 
 
 After insert data colums for artists and instrument i could plot the chords used on diffrent instrument. Here i have chosen Guitar and Piano. From the plot a comparison could be 
 seen clearly that how selection of chords varies with instument being played on.
